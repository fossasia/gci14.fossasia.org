## Developers

**Remember** : It is important that you complete a variety of tasks, but it is not enough to win just by completing the most tasks. Out of the top ten students, the finalists are picked based on the quality of their work - so you should finish your tasks as quickly as possible yet also make sure to submit a high quality work. During the process, help other participants out, engage in conversations and make friends. Most importantly, enjoy the process!
